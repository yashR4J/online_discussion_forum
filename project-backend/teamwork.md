Also includes notes on Asynochronous Standups. 

Communication was done via MS Teams Channel  Facebook Messenger. We had meetings about 2 times a week, and generally whenever an issue needed to be discussed it was just brought up immediately on the group chat, mentioning the relevant people so that they would get a notification and see the message.

For iteration 3 we split up the functions fairly in a way that each user's function didn't depend on another users. For example, one user did the auth_passwordreset functions and another user did the standups. We felt this was apprpirate way as it is end of the semester, many people are busy and pair programming may not be a suitable option as our group has to deal with 3 different timezones and it is very hard to communicate with our group member in China who has limited access to messaging apps. 

Here are the following meetings which took place during Iteration 3: 
- 7th April, 2021: 
    - Iteration 3 roles were assigned.

Areas for improvement: 
 - Time management: too much of the testing was left till last day; not a good idea, definitely need to plan better. 
 - Code redundancy: a fair of bit was reused and could have been created into helper functions.
